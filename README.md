My first full-stack web application. University coursework project (5 semester).

This application has 3 roles:

    - user (client of the warehouse, who can make orders and return ordered items);

    - employee (adds new items, replenishes stock, adds new clients and suppliers, processes orders and returns);

    - admin (creates, edits and deletes users).

In order to start this application, you need:

    - Copy code from SQLFull.sql to your database. By default database is called CP3 and its name is hardcoded on the backend in database.js;

    - After launching both backend and frontend you will be greeted with the login screen. You need to enter admin into login field. You don't need to enter a valid password. Write any random charaters there. Then you will be redirected to the admin dashboard. Set a new password for admin, user and employee in order to make authorisation work.
